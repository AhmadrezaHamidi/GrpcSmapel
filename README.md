Project Name: "GrpcClientSample"
Description
"GrpcClientSample" is a client application that demonstrates the usage of gRPC for communication with a gRPC server. The application is designed to interact with a gRPC service called "SMS" and use the defined SendSMSRequest and SendSMSResponse messages to send SMS messages.

Technologies Used
gRPC: Utilized for efficient and high-performance communication between the client application and the gRPC server.
[Add other technologies used in the project, such as ASP.NET Core, etc.]
How to Use
Install the required dependencies using NuGet Package Manager or dotnet CLI:

lua
Copy code
dotnet add package Grpc.AspNetCore --version 2.46.0
[Add instructions on how to install other required dependencies]

Import the necessary namespaces in your code:

csharp
Copy code
using GrpcClientSample.Protos; // Make sure to replace "GrpcClientSample.Protos" with the correct namespace for your project
Set up a gRPC client to interact with the "SMS" service:

csharp
Copy code
var channel = GrpcChannel.ForAddress("https://your-gRPC-server-url"); // Replace "https://your-gRPC-server-url" with the actual URL of your gRPC server
var smsClient = new SMS.SMSClient(channel);
Send an SMS message using the defined SendSMSRequest and receive a response of type SendSMSResponse:

csharp
Copy code
var request = new SendSMSRequest
{
    Mobile = "0123456789", // Replace with the destination mobile number
    Message = "Hello, this is a test message." // Replace with the actual message you want to send
};

var response = smsClient.Send(request);
if (response.IsSent)
{
    Console.WriteLine("SMS sent successfully!");
}
else
{
    Console.WriteLine("Failed to send SMS.");
}
